# Server config files managed by Eclipse
# Adjust the path based on where Eclipse creates server configs,
# it's often inside the workspace but might be in a separate project
# If your Servers are *inside* the main project folder structure, you might need to be more specific.
# If they are in a separate 'Servers' project within the workspace, ignoring .metadata/ covers it.
# If server.xml is directly *in* your project root for deployment, then you would track *that* one,
# but the one shown in your screenshot is the Eclipse-managed *copy*.
# So, generally ignore Eclipse-managed server config folders:
Servers/

# Add specific server config files if they appear outside standard ignored folders and are IDE-managed
# e.g., if you find server.xml directly under .metadata/
# .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.server.core/
# .metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.jst.server.tomcat.core/
